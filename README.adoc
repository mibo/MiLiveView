= mibo Live View (miLiVi)

A very simple tool to check modifications for a file and render a live preview (`asciidoc` or `markdown`).

== Start

Start with `sbt "run --file=<path to file>"` to build and run live view for given file.

== Building

To build a executable (_fat_) `jar` just run `sbt assembly`. This build the jar in `target/scala-2.11` as `MiLiVi-assembly-1.0.jar`.
 This can be executed with a `JRE 1.8+`.
